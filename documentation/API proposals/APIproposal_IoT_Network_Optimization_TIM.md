| API family name | IoT Network Optimization |
| API family owner | TIM |
| API summary | A Service Provider has requested the Telco Platform to instantiate an Application in different Edge Data Centers. These application instances, altogether, provide a Service offered to End User to a fleet of IoT devices. The Service Provider wants to activate network features for that specific fleet of IoT devices. The API will be extended via incremental steps with new capabilities regarding IoT devices, the first one of which is about energy saving modes. |
| Technical viability | This API can leverage on Rel 18 Nnef_ParameterProvision_Create and Nnef_ParameterProvision_Update API as defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 (Procedures for the 5G System). A reference implementation of this API is under development in IPCEI (www.ipcei-cis.eu). | 
| Commercial viability | NO. |
| YAML code available? | YES. |
| Validated in lab/productive environments? | NO. |
| Validated with real customers? | NO. |
| Validated with operators? | NO. |
